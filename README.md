# Simple-Coffee-Landing-Page
Welcome to my first project: This is a minimalistic coffee-themed landing page built with HTML and CSS.

As a beginner, I wanted to showcase my understanding of front-end development by creating a simple and visually appealing webpage. 

## Features
- Coffee-inspired color scheme.
- Minimalistic layout using HTML5 and CSS3.

Feel free to explore the project and provide feedback. I'm excited to continue learning and improving my skills!
